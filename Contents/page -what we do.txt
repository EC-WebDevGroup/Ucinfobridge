Member Social Club

Members can join different clubs based on age, background and interest. Within each club, members are able to socialize with others who have similar background and either exchange information or practice English.

Interactive Lauguage Learning

This unique language learning application, you are placed in a virtual reality in which you live in the U.S.A., forcing you to apply English as a tool to survive. In this manner, we virtually immerse you in the English language, enabling you to apply English in real world situations and learn it in a faster, fun way.

Member Interactive service
